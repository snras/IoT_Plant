many building we have.'

we're like so much rich.'

-How is it?

00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:08,272
Is it good?

Maybe this is why all uncles at my
house in the nights take a chilled beer,

forget their tensions and
jump happily like this.

True dude.

49
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:38,147
Hey, our Government should
supply beer instead of water.

50
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:41,522
Hey, leave all that. We all should
be together like this forever.

51
00:05:41,813 --> 00:05:42,522
Yes dude.

52
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:47,147
In life, we should never fight or get
separated either for girls or for money.

53
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,022
Let's keep sipping beers and live happily
like this with no tensions for life long.

-Whatever problems we get or situations...

Hurray!

59
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:06,105
That was the first beer
we had in our life.

60
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:09,877
With the kick on, we promised to
be together like this forever.

61
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:13,300
The confidence we got made us
jump over the College wall,

62
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,126
and took us till recording dance.

Hey, go slowly. That watchman may see.

83
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:15,022
Ok, climb the wall slowly.

84
00:08:15,105 --> 00:08:16,839
Hey, careful with the beer.

85
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,654
Nothing will happen to Beer,
I'm here right?

86
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,730
Hey, he's sleeping dumb.

87
00:08:23,772 --> 00:08:25,438
-Looks like he had a quarter.
-Come on, let's go.

88
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:27,701
This is the last day of our B.Tech life.

89
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:30,631
We are going to enter into the real world.

90
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:32,921
Everybodies lives are going
to start from this stage.

91
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:34,151
Including our lives.

92
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:51,818
Not him dude,
we shall say that Sekhar Kammula first.

93
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:55,201
Yes dude,
that Happy Days film affected us badly.

94
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,296
There wasn't even a single girl
in our College like Tamannaah.

95
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:00,480
Hey, we've been in this same
college from four years.

96
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:02,313
Did at least any single
girl go flat for us?

97
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:05,158
Is it? What'll you do getting a girl?

98
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:06,995
What can I say when you ask directly?

99
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,855
To hell with your shyness!

100
00:09:09,105 --> 00:09:11,605
Hey,
you'll have fun only till you get a girl.

101
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:13,688
You'll know the real
torture after you get her.

102
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:14,576
How's that dude?

103
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:16,318
-Give it here, once
-Why man?

104
00:09:17,855 --> 00:09:21,002
Girls are like the bomb.
They look great from a distance.

105
00:09:21,202 --> 00:09:23,860
And if we go close and say
relationship and my foot,

106
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,627
it's like lighting them
up and you get blasted.

107
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:27,021
Hey, go man!

108
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,016
Why did he become so bad like this?

109
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:30,088
True, dude.

110
00:09:30,288 --> 00:09:31,496
-Damn!
-Damn!

111
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:34,421
Hey, if we too had studied well,
we too would've got a girlfriend.

112
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:37,103
Hey, it's the same syllabus
from our grandparents days

113
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:38,930
and the half-knowledge
lecturers teaching that.

114
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,751
And this College ruining the
brains we already have...

115
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:44,643
All in childhood say to become
a Scientist and Astronaut,

116
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:46,966
but all turn fools after growing big.

117
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,581
No idea how many more
would become fools now.

118
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:51,064
Four years, is gone a waste!

119
00:09:53,888 --> 00:09:55,222
We shall remove this statue's head.

120
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:54,222
Why are you all stay here?

121
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:55,430
Why didn't you go for the interview?

122
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:58,371
We shouldn't go to these factories
manufacturing sheep, health gets ruined.

123
00:10:58,697 --> 00:11:00,853
Come on bro,
you think I don't know about you?

124
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:03,271
They won't even let you inside the
gate for the backlogs you have.

125
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:05,180
What are you talking too much idiot?

126
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:06,638
You want the old debt or not?

127
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:07,888
-I need bro
-Then?

128
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,414
Hey dude
-What dude?

129
00:11:09,522 --> 00:11:10,557
My job got confirmed.

130
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:13,127
Congrats bro,
we can now happily do the jobs.

131
00:11:13,227 --> 00:11:15,013
-Right dude.
-We studied well and got the job.

132
00:11:15,222 --> 00:11:16,340
-Hey Satish.
-Yes.

133
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:18,537
-How much is your salary?
-17K per month.

134
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:19,638
17K!

135
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,162
-And yours?
-Mine too is 17K per month.

136
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,428
Oh, which Company dude?

137
00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:23,138
BELL.

138
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:25,302
They'll have to live life
long ringing the bell

139
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:28,954
-Hey, what's your percentage?
-85%

140
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:31,513
-Oh. Yours?
-63%

141
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,055
Are we both into the same
company with the same salary?

142
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:38,222
Hey, why do you waste talent for
just 15 to 20K paid by that Company?

143
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:40,492
Do something on your own
and you will get better.

144
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:42,121
Huh, you're advising us?

145
00:11:42,472 --> 00:11:44,457
-Don't you wish to be going to the office?
-Hey, wait dude.

146
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:46,058
Why about these, move on man.

147
00:11:46,113 --> 00:11:48,204
-You'll get bashed.
-These idiots will never get settled.

148
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:49,624
We should've hit them.

149
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:51,439
I'd have given two shots
if he'd spoken more.

150
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:52,916
-Leave it, dude.
-No, they should get it.

151
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:53,975
Hey, lecturer!

152
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:56,475
Shucks! Sir, dude...

153
00:11:56,772 --> 00:12:00,217
If you hadn't wasted time
in smoking and studied well,

154
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,616
you too would've got good jobs
attending the interviews, right?

155
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:06,807
-You said well!
-Go sir, leave.

156
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:09,270
Fine,
but what does this lecturer teach us?

157
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:11,260
He is the M1 lecturer.
[bike starts]

158
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,189
Yes dude, he's the one who failed me.
[bike leaving]

159
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:14,872
Dude, clear that subject in this march.

160
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:15,504
-Hello brother.
-Yes.

161
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:17,661
You performed recently on an annual day,
right?

162
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:19,345
You played the guitar great, brother.

163
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,256
Okay, okay.

164
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:22,123
-Which year are you guys?
-First year, brother.

165
00:12:22,472 --> 00:12:23,638
-First year?
-Yes, brother.

166
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:26,185
-Then what is that on the ear?
-Just like that, brother.

167
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,648
-Attitude?
-No brother.

168
00:12:29,597 --> 00:12:31,923
Hey, being juniors won't you
make friends with seniors?

169
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,815
We will brother.

170
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:34,289
-And you?
-We will brother.

171
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:36,689

00:13:06,695 --> 00:13:07,311
No brother.

-Brother, please no.
-Hey, you wait. See what's in there.

00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:27,117
It's Upma brother.

194

They come in the dress what they like,
brother.

206
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,347
This sounds like some fancy
dress competition, right?

207
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:55,555
-It's like the Halloween in the US, right?
-In a way like that, brother.

208
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:58,577

No problem dude, we too are just four.

00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:18,266
Ok but are the passes including alcohol?

219
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:21,633
Bro, passes are only for the entry.
We shall buy everything inside.

Get out guys.

226
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,722
Hey Dhruv,

00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:35,180
Why dude, we are going to a

228
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:37,430
Hey fool, one beer would cost 500 there.

229
00:14:38,347 --> 00:14:40,347
We shall spend that amount,

231
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:42,805

Hey, we shall flirt with minimum
four girls in the party today.

236
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:56,680
We will but you don't
get out drinking fully.

237
00:14:56,722 --> 00:14:57,597
Nothing so dude.

238
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,513
Why did this tailor stitch a single piece?

239
00:14:59,538 --> 00:15:00,430
How to pee?

240
00:15:00,747 --> 00:15:02,263
Yes dude, I too don't understand the same.

241
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:04,610
I'm full safe, I've got great comfort.

242
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,744
He's got full freedom.

243

245
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:19,513

247
00:15:20,805 --> 00:15:22,055
The spider has arrived.

Oh no! Mummy!

249
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:26,347
He's caught.

250
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,722
What's this? Won't you change at all?

251
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:34,930
You always are with these waste
friends into roaming and drinking.

252
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,636
Isn't there anything in life, Chey?

253
00:15:37,055 --> 00:15:40,388
Hey, won't you leave him
till he's completely ruined?

254
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:42,638
Go and do something useful.

255
00:15:42,763 --> 00:15:44,094
-We're in the same thing now, right?
-Damn!

256
00:15:45,164 --> 00:15:45,795
Thank God!

-Come on, is this any new for us?

You take this beer.

260
00:15:51,638 --> 00:15:52,602
Hey Dhruv, hold this.

261
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:54,952

what's the use of that life?

00:18:07,977 --> 00:18:13,967
-Kiss... Kiss...

I'd a wish from long
back to kiss Spiderman.

270
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:10,136
And I always wanted to
make out with an angel.

271
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:14,764
Let's kiss?
"Why don't you stay?"

Muah... Muah...

274
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:32,541
What's he chewing in the air?

275
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,305
Did he have any adultered drink or what?

276
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:35,560
Muah... Muah...

277
00:19:35,722 --> 00:19:37,055

-What the hell?
-Bro, it's bleeding.

Please leave Sir.

scolded and beaten up by my dad.

346
00:23:32,497 --> 00:23:34,660
Hey, keep the phone in.
Hold the board properly.

347
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:35,895
What are they saying, dude?

348
00:23:37,455 --> 00:23:38,539
There's a Cricket match
in the evening it seems.

349
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:39,585
Ok, let's go then.

350
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,595
Come on, come on. [indistinct voices]

351
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:48,318
I'm still thinking
about that angel girl dude.

352
00:23:48,622 --> 00:23:50,296
She'd have forgotten you long back.

353
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:51,372
Are you sure?

354
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,847
Still, why about that girl's mess for you?
Watch the match.

355
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:56,872
Oh, well played. [phone ringing]

356
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:58,205
No, no! Ok, ok!

357
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,705
Hi, who is this?

358
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,538
Hi, this is Riya.

359
00:24:01,913 --> 00:24:03,788
Sorry, I don't know anyone named Riya.

360
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:06,913
You sent a note to me yesterday
with the waiter, right?

361
00:24:07,205 --> 00:24:09,615
Oh God! Bro, that girl called.

362
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,122
-Who, customer care?
-No dude, that angel girl.

363
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:15,455
-Hey Riya.
-He's out now.

364
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:18,205
So, you saved my number.

365
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:21,808
How are you?

366
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:24,782
I'm doing good,
just the nose is a bit swollen.

367
00:24:24,982 --> 00:24:27,830
Hey,
I'm so sorry for what that idiot has done.

368
00:24:27,955 --> 00:24:31,205
Yes, it's ok.
You called me as he hit me, right?

369
00:24:32,163 --> 00:24:34,107
I'd have called even if he hadn't hit.

370
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:35,231
Oh, cool.

371
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,008
You're a guitarist, right?

372
00:24:37,288 --> 00:24:38,630
Yes, how do you know?

373
00:24:39,163 --> 00:24:42,604
I got it when I searched your
name and phone number in FB.

374
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:43,792
Oh, cool.

375
00:24:44,247 --> 00:24:47,866
I was thinking, learning to play
the guitar. Can you teach me?

376
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,622
-Yes, definitely.
-Perfect.

377
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:01,684

378
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:03,863

380
00:25:08,163 --> 00:25:09,995

Hey, this guy too...

394
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:57,288

-That's what I'm saying, right?

402
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,830
You rascal... Hey...

Come, come, come... Come on sit.

Where were you for so many years Geetha?

431
00:27:48,455 --> 00:27:50,822
Entire happiness was gone
because of you in my life.

432
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,740
My Psycho dad put me in all
girls colleges after school.

433
00:27:55,413 --> 00:27:56,788
No smart phone too.

434
00:27:56,913 --> 00:27:59,372
He won't let me go anywhere.
He won't let me roam with anyone.

435
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:02,663
I should take this fatty along with me,
wherever I wish to go.

436
00:28:02,788 --> 00:28:03,424
You eat dear.

437
00:28:03,524 --> 00:28:05,243
My entire life has become a torture.

438
00:28:05,955 --> 00:28:07,330
Why not search for positive even in this?

439
00:28:07,455 --> 00:28:09,705
See how beautiful have
you become being at home?

440

you everything you missed in life.

Huh, that isn't possible.

443
00:28:17,122 --> 00:28:19,124
My dad won't let me go
anywhere from the house.

444
00:28:19,224 --> 00:28:20,274
I'll take care of all that.

445
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,992
From now on,
your job is just to be happy, that's all.

446
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:27,098
For Arya,
his first love Geetha was seen again.

447
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,247
Whereas in my case,
a girl called me to her house directly.

00:32:34,897 --> 00:32:38,455
Hey, what are you doing here?
Neighbours will see, sit down.

519
00:32:41,455 --> 00:32:43,389
Hey, you don't take any tension.
None will see.

520
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:46,348
Still, I got you a gift.
Guess, what did I get?

521
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,421
-What?
-You'll be surprised.

522
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:51,163
Here...

523
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,205
What's this?

524
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:53,413
See...

525
00:32:57,872 --> 00:32:59,038
You remember?

526
00:32:59,122 --> 00:33:00,122
I should forget to remember, right?

527
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,877
-That's so sweet.
-Thank you.

528
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:05,790
Huh! The sky is so beautiful, right?

529
00:33:06,205 --> 00:33:07,955
That moon, stars...

530
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:10,330
Actually, give your phone.

531
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:11,205
Why?

532
00:33:11,372 --> 00:33:12,882
-Give the phone.
-Ok.

533
00:33:15,013 --> 00:33:15,655
What are you doing?

534
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:19,863
See...

535
00:33:21,747 --> 00:33:22,413
What's that?

536
00:33:22,872 --> 00:33:24,122
-See.
-Oh my!

537
00:33:24,413 --> 00:33:26,353
See our stars and our zodiac signs.

538
00:33:26,663 --> 00:33:28,070
What, we can see even stars in this?

539
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:28,793
Yeah.

540
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,176
This is so crazy.

541
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:32,773
Actually, I like stargazing a lot.

542
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,157
-Ok.
-Our lives change...

543
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:36,391
...with these planets and their movements.

544
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:38,372
By any chance, would you say
something like horoscope?

545
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:39,076
Yeah.

546
00:33:39,276 --> 00:33:41,045
I like palm reading very much.

547
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:41,830
Show me your hand.

548
00:33:42,655 --> 00:33:43,960
You like palm reading?

549
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:46,923
-Say what all would we do now?
-Ok.

550
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:52,412
This line says we will
go for a long drive.

551
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:53,330
Ok.

552
00:33:54,288 --> 00:33:57,538
This line says, we'll dance in the club.

553
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:00,163
You said so many lines, right?

554
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:04,153
Then what is this big line
saying we would do more?

555
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:34,455
What happened?

556
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:35,997
Riya, I've to leave.

557
00:34:36,247 --> 00:34:38,741
-I can't teach you guitar any more.
-What's wrong?

558
00:34:39,205 --> 00:34:40,284
I can't any more Riya.

559
00:34:41,372 --> 00:34:44,372
Chai, what's this childish behaviour?
Tell me, what's wrong?

560
00:34:44,497 --> 00:34:46,205
I don't know how to say this to you Riya.

561
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,163
Either I see you or touch,
something is happening inside me...

562
00:34:50,163 --> 00:34:53,872
Especially that tattoo on your neck,
all my focus is going on to that.

563
00:34:54,247 --> 00:34:55,913
I'm unable to concentrate at all.

564
00:34:56,038 --> 00:34:57,163
Ok, ok!

565
00:34:57,247 --> 00:34:58,913
Calm down... calm down...

566
00:35:03,413 --> 00:35:06,747
Your eyes, your fragrance,
that style of pushing your hairs back...

567
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:08,163
It's all driving me crazy.

568
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,905
I'm unable to concentrate at all.
It's better for me and you, I'll leave.

569
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:15,554
"Why not stay back?"

570
00:35:18,622 --> 00:35:20,261
[indistinct music]

571
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:21,937
-Bro.
-Yes.

572
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:24,955
We get fair with this cut fruit
facial, right? [radio playing]

573
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:26,954
-"Kanulanu Thaake song from Manam movie"
-Yes, bro.

574
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,065
We should shine.

575
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:31,625
With the same hand,
apply if you have some whitewash too, bro.

576
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:35,247
-The boy should shine very fair.
-You stay calm, bro.

577
00:35:35,428 --> 00:35:39,310
Hey Bunty, I'm great excited and
a bit scared at the same time too.

578
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,091
Why dude?

579
00:35:40,245 --> 00:35:44,896
If those girls are horrible
unlike in the photos,

580
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:46,398
what's our situation dude?

581
00:35:46,637 --> 00:35:47,224
Get up once.

582
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:57,364
Idiot, we'll go there and see the girls.
We'll take them on a date if they're good.

583
00:35:57,464 --> 00:36:00,192
If they aren't good looking then act
if you are attacked with Asthma.

584
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:00,957
What?

585
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:04,123
[panting]

586
00:36:04,252 --> 00:36:06,659
Saying Oh God,
something happened to my friend,

587
00:36:07,015 --> 00:36:07,650
let's escape from there.

588
00:36:09,345 --> 00:36:10,970
-Simple.
-Bunty, you are super.

589
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,163
Urgh! Damn!

590
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,422
What are you like this, dude?
[radio playing]

591
00:36:15,522 --> 00:36:17,015
What's wrong, just the face pack, right?

592
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,157
Damn, sit down. "Radio: Gallo
Telinattunde song from the film Jalsa"

593
00:36:20,257 --> 00:36:26,163
[mouthing song]

594
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:34,755
Hey Bunty,
I'm very excited thinking about the date.

595
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,512
Super Bunty, you're great.

596
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:39,577
-What's this, you still didn't remove?
-Hey, don't touch that.

597
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:40,682
[honking] What happened?

598
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,308
-Do you know how much is that?
-How much?

599
00:36:43,053 --> 00:36:45,042
-Rs. 8000 dude.
-Rs. 8000?

600
00:36:45,142 --> 00:36:46,246
-Yeah.
-So what?

601
00:36:46,512 --> 00:36:52,387
I bought it today, go for a date and
return it tomorrow.

602
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,016
Bro Bunty, you're super.
You're a God, that's all.

603
00:36:57,512 --> 00:36:58,733
Hey, I think we've come.

604
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:01,551
Hey, there's a meter in the dashboard.
Give it here, once.

605
00:37:06,513 --> 00:37:09,126
[blowing]

606
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,673
37 means manageable come on move.
[honking]

607
00:37:12,428 --> 00:37:13,512
Where did you get this from?

608
00:37:13,637 --> 00:37:15,299
Do you remember, we got caught
in drunk and drive last time?

609
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,204
-Umm... Is it on the costume party day?
-I picked up there.

610
00:37:21,012 --> 00:37:23,781
Bro,
you're in crazier form than Virat Kohli.

611
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:26,224
Come on, move. Let's go in the
same flow and make the girls lie down.

612
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:28,284
[indistinct music]

613
00:37:28,668 --> 00:37:29,576
-Bro...
-Yes.

614
00:37:29,887 --> 00:37:31,903
-I recently read a survey.
-About what?

615
00:37:32,387 --> 00:37:35,597
In between 20 to 25 years of age, we
should do 122 times sex per year it seems.

616
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:37,500
If not, health gets spoilt, you know?

617
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:39,421
122...

618
00:37:39,621 --> 00:37:43,063
Hey, maybe that is the reason
I feel very weak these days.

619
00:37:43,163 --> 00:37:45,806
It won't be from now dude. Still, thanks
to you. Girls are coming because of you.

620
00:37:46,095 --> 00:37:48,642
I'm saying from today, our game starts.

621
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,663
We shall play dude, we shall play well.

622
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:52,220
Hurray!

623
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,418
Why are they not still coming dude?

624
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:55,075
It's time and they should be here by now,
right?

625
00:37:55,512 --> 00:37:57,645
-Hey. See they are coming.
-Is it them?

626
00:37:59,928 --> 00:38:01,365
-Hey wow.
-Set your dress.

627
00:38:16,237 --> 00:38:20,507
-Hey, they're in no way like in photos.
-Why are they so bad dude?

628
00:38:20,803 --> 00:38:21,995
Come on dude, let's go away.

629
00:38:22,117 --> 00:38:23,296
Start it dude, start it.

630
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:27,872
[panting]

631
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:29,385
-Hey, are you ok?
-Madam, are you ok?

632
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,961
[panting]
Sruthi, what's wrong?

633
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:33,597
What happened?

634
00:38:35,137 --> 00:38:37,481
They look like Hippopotamus and why
are they doing like this by seeing us?

635
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:38,268
To hell with our life!

636
00:38:38,468 --> 00:38:40,562
My friend is got Asthma attack,
somebody help.

637
00:38:40,603 --> 00:38:41,565
-She'd get.
-Help!

638
00:38:41,665 --> 00:38:43,574
When she is so fat like a drum what else
would she get other than Asthma attack?

639
00:38:43,603 --> 00:38:45,252
She's drum idiot.

640
00:38:45,412 --> 00:38:48,556
You say me a drum idiot?
You look like a bear, you rascal.

641
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:50,202
How do you know that my
friend's name is that?

642
00:38:50,402 --> 00:38:51,960
-Hey!
-It's known by just looks.

643
00:38:52,262 --> 00:38:54,529
Hey, Buffalo won't become a
cow when it is coloured white.

644
00:38:54,629 --> 00:38:55,314
She is also similar to that.

645
00:38:55,553 --> 00:38:56,848
You say me a buffalo, rascal?

646
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:07,874
-Hey, my blazer dude...
-It's 8000...

647
00:39:20,762 --> 00:39:22,197
Hey Bunty, come on dude

648
00:39:22,397 --> 00:39:23,145
Who's this in between?
[glass breaks]

649
00:39:23,245 --> 00:39:25,678
-Hey run fast, faster.
-Hey...

650
00:39:25,762 --> 00:39:26,720
Hey caught me dude.

651
00:39:26,787 --> 00:39:29,090
-Look at him.
-Hey, it will tear...

652
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,666
It ripped.
Hey my hand, dude.

653
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:33,149
-Hey bunty come fast.
-Come fast.

654
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,533
Hey, he is coming dude.
Run fast.

655
00:39:39,387 --> 00:39:43,247
God, won't you show mercy at all?
What sin have I done?

656
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,491
Give me just one girlfriend, please.

657
00:39:45,962 --> 00:39:50,012
For the insult faced in double date,
Dhruv just believed Facebook.

658
00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:55,461
Damn! Damn!

659
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:58,958
What's this God, what are these
fake profiles? Will anyone do so?

660
00:39:59,928 --> 00:40:03,135
Get me a good original girl, my God.
I'll take great care of her.

661
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:04,691
Please don't do so.

662
00:40:04,891 --> 00:40:05,348
[gasps]

663
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:09,928
Soumya Reddy accepted your friend request.

664
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:13,788
Is she from Mumbai! No problem, the
girl is so nice. [laptop beeps]

665
00:40:14,637 --> 00:40:16,691
Hi! What do you do?

666
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:19,387
Television: Till it turns into brownish.

667
00:40:19,428 --> 00:40:23,637
This great lady watches the cookery
shows on TV for the whole day,

668
00:40:23,678 --> 00:40:26,970
but always does the same roasted Dosa.

669
00:40:27,112 --> 00:40:31,720
Pulihora with yesterday's rice and
the same dal and ladyfinger.

670
00:40:33,428 --> 00:40:33,887
Damn!

671
00:40:34,153 --> 00:40:37,200
Yes, go to your daughter's
house and she cooks you well.

672
00:40:37,678 --> 00:40:39,262
Bunty! Bunty!

673
00:40:40,095 --> 00:40:45,056
I'm working hard daily for day and night
and bringing you food at your mouth.

674
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:45,666
Yes.

675
00:40:45,866 --> 00:40:48,803
Even to the office, I go
wearing only 400 rupees shirt.

676
00:40:49,554 --> 00:40:50,645
You're grown up like a donkey.

677
00:40:51,156 --> 00:40:55,769
You roam whole night with your waste
friends and get up at 12 in the noon.

678
00:40:56,012 --> 00:40:58,304
You want 8000 worth
suit for your damn face,

679
00:40:58,504 --> 00:41:00,209
and tearing the same too in just one day.

680
00:41:01,487 --> 00:41:05,313
Dad, you just go to the office and thus
400 worth shirt is enough for you.

681
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:10,762
But I roam out for the whole day. Many
people do meet me and many keep seeing me.

682
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:13,787
-And thus is this blazer for me.
-What's so important work for you, man?

683
00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:15,619
You can't understand even if I say you,
dad.

684
00:41:15,987 --> 00:41:19,483
This great lady serves me the
leftover curries from the night.

685
00:41:19,783 --> 00:41:22,615
-and a coat worth 8000 for him?
-Exactly.

Will anyone eat?

687
00:41:33,162 --> 00:41:35,664
God! I'm into a video chat
with Soumya for the first time.

688
00:41:35,764 --> 00:41:37,808
Please, make her be very beautiful.

689
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:41,916
I'm saying, from now I won't do any sins,
be good and become a good guy. Please God!

690
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:46,073
One, two, three...

691
00:41:46,678 --> 00:41:47,825
Are you going for any job interview?

692
00:41:48,262 --> 00:41:51,572
Six... Job!
Damn, nothing as such.

693
00:41:51,772 --> 00:41:54,338
Seven, eight, nine.

694
00:41:55,996 --> 00:41:56,561
Please God.

Hi.

697
00:42:14,136 --> 00:42:16,109
One minute Soumya,
one minute, one minute!

698
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,862
My God, you're great and you exist.

699
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:27,440
Thank you God!

700
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,009
Yes! Yes!

701
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:35,097
I never drank
-What, you never had a beer?

702
00:42:35,197 --> 00:42:36,642
-No.
-Never had a beer in a lifetime?

703
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:38,020
-No.
-What are you saying?

704
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,185
You know what you're missing out on?

705
00:42:39,752 --> 00:42:40,371
Yuck!

706
00:42:41,678 --> 00:42:42,732
-Have one sip.
-No.

707
00:42:42,932 --> 00:42:44,209
I'm saying right?
Have one sip.

708
00:42:49,737 --> 00:42:52,779
-It's crazy, right?
-Actually, it's not that bad.

709
00:42:54,552 --> 00:42:55,205
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

710
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,613

Baby, I think this is life.
We shall own this all in future.

742
00:47:05,797 --> 00:47:07,082
Yes, totally.

743
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,677
-Let's go to US.
-What?

744
00:47:09,137 --> 00:47:10,792
Yes, let's go to US.

745
00:47:10,992 --> 00:47:14,172
Let's first do Masters there
and then settle there doing jobs.

746
00:47:14,272 --> 00:47:16,210
-I'll take care of everything.
-What?

747
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:19,081
I had a dream from
childhood to settle in the US.

748
00:47:19,181 --> 00:47:22,774
All my cousins are right
there and leading a Royal life.

00:47:23,112 --> 00:47:24,039
-Baby...
-Yes.

750
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:25,315
Are you hungry?

751
00:47:25,965 --> 00:47:26,484
No.

752
00:47:26,684 --> 00:47:28,928
-If not, are you on your periods?
-No

753
00:47:29,345 --> 00:47:30,938
Then why are you talking crazy like this?

754
00:47:31,678 --> 00:47:34,298
What crazy, I'm talking with clarity.

755
00:47:34,398 --> 00:47:38,116
If you're here, you will be unfit for
anything like your waste friends.

756
00:47:38,245 --> 00:47:39,527
Why did they come in between now?

757
00:47:40,368 --> 00:47:43,225
Ok, leave about them.
What'll you do being here?

758
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:44,772
I'll do something.

759
00:47:45,137 --> 00:47:47,543
Settle down fast or else we'll move to US.

760
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:57,016
Arya, you earn about 15000 per month.

761
00:47:57,116 --> 00:47:57,542
Yes.

762
00:47:58,178 --> 00:48:01,117
I'll sell my paintings
and earn about Rs. 10000.

763
00:48:01,387 --> 00:48:04,502
We can live happily with that Rs. 25000.

764
00:48:05,678 --> 00:48:09,277
We shall spend Rs. 20000 from that Rs.
25000 for your shopping and cosmetics.

765
00:48:09,362 --> 00:48:11,250
-Is it ok?
-Love you baby.

766
00:48:12,612 --> 00:48:15,938
Fine Arya,
we'll be the same forever, right?

767
00:48:16,512 --> 00:48:18,380
My dad will accept you, right?

768
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,962
Geetha, suffering on one
side thinking about the past,

769
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:26,776
and fear on the other thinking about
future, you're ruining the present.

770
00:48:26,876 --> 00:48:30,682
See, how beautiful is the moment?
Hey, enjoy and treasure it.

771
00:48:31,362 --> 00:48:33,483
-Cherish every moment.
-Are you sure?

772
00:48:33,929 --> 00:48:34,653
Yes.

-Hi Baby.

Hi.

776
00:48:45,301 --> 00:48:47,277
-What's this?
-One second.

777
00:48:48,487 --> 00:48:50,744
See, how good your name looks on my hand.

778
00:48:51,978 --> 00:48:53,279
Yes, it's very good.

779
00:48:53,553 --> 00:48:55,322
So, I'm completely yours now.

780
00:48:56,023 --> 00:48:56,471
Cool.

781
00:48:56,571 --> 00:48:58,460
-You too have my name, come on.
-What?

782
00:48:58,887 --> 00:49:01,426
-Come on, nothing will happen.
-No, I won't.

783
00:49:01,626 --> 00:49:04,424
-No, sit. Nothing will happen.
-Riya please, I'll get in later.

784
00:49:04,724 --> 00:49:06,246
-Baby, nothing happens.
-Nothing will happen.

785
00:49:06,346 --> 00:49:08,059
-Wait bro.
-Please, please.

786
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,237
-Hey, mom is calling. She even called me.
-Hello bro.

787
00:49:10,337 --> 00:49:11,614
-Go later, nothing happens.
-I got to go, have urgent work.

788
00:49:11,714 --> 00:49:12,484
-It takes just two minutes bro.
-Nothing happens.

789
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:14,345
-You hold on.
-Nothing happens.

790
00:49:14,437 --> 00:49:17,100
Actually, I'm allergic to
needles and I shouldn't have it.

791
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,518
I get swelling all over the body.

792
00:49:18,762 --> 00:49:20,403
So, you don't like me...

793
00:49:20,503 --> 00:49:21,715
-Nothing so Riya.
-Then get it done.

794
00:49:21,815 --> 00:49:22,457
Bro, nothing happens.

795
00:49:22,657 --> 00:49:26,298
Mummy!

796
00:49:26,928 --> 00:49:27,710
Tell me about yourself.

797
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:29,928
Madam, I don't want money.
You are so beautiful.

798
00:49:31,145 --> 00:49:32,719
Why are you hesitating for this?

799
00:49:33,841 --> 00:49:35,946
Everyone talks askew.

800
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,384
You look like a straight forward guy.

801
00:49:39,153 --> 00:49:40,727
-Dude.
-Yes.

802
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,811
-What do they call when four do together?
-Foursome.

803
00:49:45,153 --> 00:49:47,009
-Three.
-Threesome.

804
00:49:48,195 --> 00:49:51,032
-And two.
-Awesome.

805
00:49:54,737 --> 00:49:58,897
I finally understood dude,
why all call me handsome...

806
00:50:02,795 --> 00:50:06,833
Yes bro, none would be as handsome
as you in the whole of twin cities.

807
00:50:08,504 --> 00:50:09,070
See there, dude.

808
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:16,626
-Hey, see those views.
-That's why our population grew so much.

809
00:50:16,726 --> 00:50:17,822
Yes, maybe!

810
00:50:19,597 --> 00:50:20,353
[door shuts]

811
00:50:21,695 --> 00:50:22,249
What happened dude?

812
00:50:25,595 --> 00:50:26,615
Hey, I lost a lot of blood.

813
00:50:28,603 --> 00:50:29,981
Aww! so cute.

814
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,507
They pierced many needles.

815
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:32,628
-Is it like this?
-Ouch!

816
00:50:32,728 --> 00:50:34,657
-Hey, he'll die.
-Oh God!

817
00:50:35,057 --> 00:50:38,021
That is the reason we say
not to mess with the girls.

818
00:50:38,038 --> 00:50:38,487
Yes!

819
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,576
Looks to be a stupid psychopath,
will anyone do so?

820
00:50:42,803 --> 00:50:44,231
Hey, she is talking rubbish.

821
00:50:44,769 --> 00:50:47,946
She says, I should settle down fast
else she would take me to the U.S.

822
00:50:48,203 --> 00:50:50,664
-What does the settlement mean?
-Is it about earning money?

823
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:51,737
I think so.

824
00:50:52,653 --> 00:50:54,174
Hey, you need money now right?

825
00:50:54,554 --> 00:50:55,084
Yes.

826
00:50:55,362 --> 00:50:57,951
-We'll take care of that, ok?
-Ok.

827
00:50:58,553 --> 00:51:00,101
Fine. Come on, come...
good hot scene is on.

828
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:12,689
So, what's my role?

829
00:51:15,729 --> 00:51:17,996
God has just created you.
[crow]

830
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,521
-Huh!
-Hmm...

831
00:51:21,243 --> 00:51:23,676
You're looking at each
other for the first time.

832
00:51:25,902 --> 00:51:28,510
-Some unknown great shiver in the body.
-Hmm...

833
00:51:28,723 --> 00:51:31,370
-A wish to touch each other.
-Ahh!

834
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:33,134
Slowly touching like that...

835
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,729
Slowly...

836
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,646
Carry on in the flow...

837
00:51:39,256 --> 00:51:41,690
-Sounds interesting.
-Hmm...

838
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,228
Rasikaraja productions,
Screams in the forest, scene 1, take 1...

839
00:51:45,632 --> 00:51:47,086
-Action!
-Be depressed.

840
00:51:47,286 --> 00:51:48,407
You aren't understanding anything at all.

841
00:51:48,711 --> 00:51:50,767
Not knowing where you're
too, same ways, a sad face...

842
00:51:51,515 --> 00:51:52,405
Look up at the God...

843
00:51:52,793 --> 00:51:56,377
Why God, your count
16000, my count why not even 1?

844
00:51:56,934 --> 00:51:58,184
You suddenly saw a girl there.

845
00:52:01,394 --> 00:52:04,239
Finally God showed mercy
and sent a beautiful girl.

846
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:06,603
Give a smile.

847
00:52:09,723 --> 00:52:10,876
Bite the apple sexily.

848
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,888
Turn it, turn... right!

849
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,412
Get up slowly!

850
00:52:17,937 --> 00:52:20,437
Carry that smile, smile... Yes, exactly.

851
00:52:20,999 --> 00:52:22,475
Hit that stick to the ground...

852
00:52:23,902 --> 00:52:26,760
Hang holding the rope like
Tarzan to impress that girl.

853
00:52:27,033 --> 00:52:29,269
Come on Tarzan dear, did
you hold the rope? Hold it.

-Where do we have so much money dude?

We don't have any
special talents too in us.

Hey, all say job but a cab driver
earns more than the software guy today.

1010
01:01:55,973 --> 01:02:00,857
So basically, we don't have any rule to do
only job but we can even drive a cab, ok?

01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,322
[door knocks]

1030
01:03:30,091 --> 01:03:31,628
Uncle, will you please call Riya?

1031
01:03:31,857 --> 01:03:33,941
Riya isn't home dear,
she has gone out on consultancy work.

1032
01:03:35,765 --> 01:03:37,720
-Any problem Chey?
-When'd she come back uncle?

1033
01:03:38,438 --> 01:03:39,919
Don't know dear, maybe she'd get late.

1034
01:03:43,117 --> 01:03:46,167
Argh!

1035
01:03:46,792 --> 01:03:48,303
[car honks]

1036
01:03:48,755 --> 01:03:49,892
Argh!

1037
01:03:51,629 --> 01:03:54,346
[phone rings]

1038
01:03:59,318 --> 01:04:01,645
[dog barks]

1039
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:50,769
See him driving a cab,
is this called to become responsible?

1040
01:04:51,309 --> 01:04:53,630
We'll be in US by this time tomorrow.

1041
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:55,356
I was calling even you for the party.

1042
01:04:55,677 --> 01:04:58,314
But who'd drop us in cab?

1043
01:04:58,514 --> 01:04:59,198
What do you say Riya? Right Riya?

1044
01:04:59,461 --> 01:05:01,290
[laughing]
Hey, Surya... come here.

1045
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:03,415
Someone is calling you.

1046
01:05:03,615 --> 01:05:05,370
-Someone
-Hey, hi bro.

1047
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:06,516
Crazy party bro.

1048
01:05:07,764 --> 01:05:09,742
-Chey, that is...
-Do me a small help Riya.

1049
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:12,301
Don't talk anything for some time.

1050
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:18,852
Just stand there till I leave.
I want to remember all this.

1051
01:05:19,988 --> 01:05:23,178
-What do you wish to remember?
-Such never happened to me, Riya.

1052
01:05:23,645 --> 01:05:26,553
-What didn't happen?
-My heart breaking.

1053
01:05:26,753 --> 01:05:30,600
"I did a mistake believing you,"

1054
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,702
"I'm going away with open eyes"

1055
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:38,782
"Like breathe stops and life goes,"

1056
01:05:39,065 --> 01:05:42,463
"Your cheating is so"

1057
01:05:42,663 --> 01:05:46,889
"Like the fire hidden in the fist,"

1058
01:05:47,315 --> 01:05:50,600
"Is the time spent with you..."

1059
01:05:51,223 --> 01:05:54,935
"Tears aren't rolling down"

1060
01:05:55,438 --> 01:05:58,768
"There isn't a way to drive away the pain"

1061
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:03,096
"I understood today
that forgetting is so easy"

1062
01:06:03,455 --> 01:06:06,604
"By seeing you"

1063
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,960
"Isn't there a way to heal,"

1064
01:06:10,638 --> 01:06:14,146
"The wound done by the time?"

1065
01:06:14,527 --> 01:06:18,434
"Piercing a thorn in my heart,"

1066
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:22,562
"You killed me so"

1067
01:06:22,672 --> 01:06:25,023
"I can't say out,"

1068
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:29,741
"the sorrow with you..."

1069
01:06:33,391 --> 01:06:34,705
-Doctor!
-Ward boy!

1070
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,993
Hey, he looks thin but is
like a buffalo to carry.

1071
01:06:38,251 --> 01:06:41,310
Is he any Devadasu,
drinking as his girl left him?

1072
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:42,040
Hey, hold the hand.

1073
01:06:44,108 --> 01:06:46,152
He cut his hand and
fainted seeing his own blood.

1074
01:06:46,493 --> 01:06:47,403
Go on, come on go on

1075
01:06:47,741 --> 01:06:49,132
Oh no!

1076
01:06:49,412 --> 01:06:50,664
Would he break the car when given?

1077
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,916
I've been saying from first
not to get into girls mess.

1078
01:06:53,981 --> 01:06:55,498
Our guys won't
understand unless experienced.

1079
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:56,948
He ruined gang's prestige.

1080
01:07:08,412 --> 01:07:09,147
Excuse me Sir...

1081
01:07:10,041 --> 01:07:11,024
-Hello...
-Yes!

1082
01:07:12,169 --> 01:07:14,198
-Sir... Here.
-Huh?

1083
01:07:17,203 --> 01:07:17,903
Take it.

1084
01:07:29,075 --> 01:07:29,993
-Hey, Arya!
-Yes!

1085
01:07:30,853 --> 01:07:31,642
See this bill dude.

1086
01:07:37,807 --> 01:07:38,757
Hey, this isn't ours dude.

1087
01:07:44,882 --> 01:07:46,574
Hey, it's of Chey.

1088
01:07:55,149 --> 01:07:56,639
Hey, what's this bill?

1089
01:07:57,143 --> 01:07:58,458
Why did the hospital guys loot like this?

1090
01:08:00,601 --> 01:08:01,647
Go and call that Doctor.

1091
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:04,251
-Doctor.
-Come on, call him.

1092
01:08:05,038 --> 01:08:05,957
-Doctor.
-Hey, Doctor.

1093
01:08:06,667 --> 01:08:09,693
-Where is this fellow?
-What is this? Is this a bill or what?

1094
01:08:10,525 --> 01:08:11,822
Are all your private hospitals like this?

1095
01:08:12,867 --> 01:08:14,831
Will anyone bill
40,000 for a small hand cut?

1096
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,408
What's this cheating, man?

1097
01:08:16,681 --> 01:08:18,954
Your friend has
anaplastic astrocytoma condition.

1098
01:08:19,274 --> 01:08:21,343
-What?
-There's a tumor in the brain.

1099
01:08:21,642 --> 01:08:23,058
-That means?
-Cancer!

1100
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:47,455
It was all because of you.

1101
01:08:48,663 --> 01:08:51,122
He became unfit for
anything in his career.

1102
01:08:52,455 --> 01:08:54,788
He became mad going behind a girl.

1103
01:08:55,288 --> 01:08:58,080
Now, he got cancer.

1104
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:01,413
Won't you leave him till he dies?

1105
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:03,788
Damn!

1106
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:11,538
Doctor,
did that injury cause him get cancer?

1107
01:09:11,663 --> 01:09:13,288
That injury actually helped.

1108
01:09:13,372 --> 01:09:15,747
We could diagnose cancer because of that.

1109
01:09:17,455 --> 01:09:18,788
Why did he actually get cancer, sir?

1110
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:20,997
There are so many reasons.

1111
01:09:21,747 --> 01:09:25,955
Even Chai's father died from brain tumour
and so this can even be a hereditary case.

1112
01:09:26,247 --> 01:09:27,955
Sir, how about treatment now?

1113
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:30,038
We need advanced chemotherapy treatment.

1114
01:09:30,247 --> 01:09:33,413
It would slowly destroy
the tumour and its cells.

1115
01:09:33,497 --> 01:09:35,855
So, there are 80% of
chances for him to recover.

1116
01:09:35,955 --> 01:09:37,080
What about the remaining 20%?

1117
01:09:37,247 --> 01:09:38,075
If tumour aggravates,

1118
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:40,971
we'll have to perform a surgery and
remove the tumour as a last option.

1119
01:09:41,071 --> 01:09:43,913
And we can't even guarantee
five per cent success rate.

1120
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:46,913
Moreover, we'll have to bring down doctors
from the USA to perform that surgery.

1121
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:48,863
It might cost more than 30 lakh rupees.

1122
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:52,997
But first, inform the
patient that he got cancer.

1123
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:57,913
Hey, what shall we do now dude?

1124
01:09:58,288 --> 01:10:01,955
Madam, go and pay the bill
immediately at the counter.

1125
01:10:20,913 --> 01:10:23,205
Hey, he should recover at
the chemotherapy stage itself.

1126
01:10:24,288 --> 01:10:27,580
You are right dude. If not, where do
we get 30 lakhs for the operation?

1127
01:10:27,855 --> 01:10:29,705
How do we say this matter to Chey, dude?

1128
01:10:30,038 --> 01:10:32,622
Hey, you don't get tensed
and make him get tensed.

1129
01:10:33,538 --> 01:10:35,880
Hey, we shall handle in a cool way. Okay?

1130
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,394
[door unlocks]
[machine beeping]

1131
01:10:37,872 --> 01:10:38,747
Hey chey!

1132
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:41,497
-Chey, what're you doing?
-Are you bored?

1133
01:10:41,997 --> 01:10:43,913
You're taking good rest
and enjoying, aren't you?

1134
01:10:44,413 --> 01:10:45,497
Hey, what's wrong with me?

1135
01:10:45,605 --> 01:10:47,705
They put me in a hospital for
so long for such a small cut.

1136
01:10:48,872 --> 01:10:52,038
Nothing dude. It is normal.
You just got a small disease.

1137
01:10:52,663 --> 01:10:54,122
Disease?
What disease?

1138
01:10:56,247 --> 01:10:59,122
You had drinks in the pain
that girl left you, didn't you?

1139
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:01,080
Okay. So?

1140
01:11:01,288 --> 01:11:03,913
-So...
-You got cancer it seems.

1141
01:11:04,913 --> 01:11:05,663
Cancer?

1142
01:11:11,038 --> 01:11:14,629
Hey, give up drink and cigarette first
and take healthy food and medicines.

1143
01:11:14,721 --> 01:11:15,389
It'll be cured.

1144
01:11:15,514 --> 01:11:17,644
Hey, don't you worry much.

1145
01:11:17,652 --> 01:11:19,788
The doctors told that it will
get cured within three months.

1146
01:11:23,438 --> 01:11:24,397
Will I die, dude?

1147
01:11:28,122 --> 01:11:30,955
Hey, it's unlike olden times.
Now, there's a cure for cancer.

1148
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:32,955
What about my mom's situation, dude?

1149
01:11:33,288 --> 01:11:35,330
Hey, don't you be tensed.

1150
01:11:35,688 --> 01:11:38,294
The doctor clearly
explained everything to your mom

1151
01:11:38,518 --> 01:11:39,830
that you'd get cured and
nothing would happen to you.

1152
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:43,173
Hey, a lot of people used to die
for small diseases at earlier times.

1153
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:45,165
Such as typhoid, TB etc.

1154
01:11:45,265 --> 01:11:47,747
But now, just one injection is
enough and everything gets cured.

1155
01:11:47,955 --> 01:11:50,122
Yes dude, it's unlike earlier times.

1156
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:52,080
There are plenty of advanced
treatments available out there.

1157
01:11:52,163 --> 01:11:53,163
What treatment, dude?

1158
01:11:55,372 --> 01:11:56,247
Keematherapy (Chemotherapy)

1159
01:11:56,455 --> 01:11:57,497
You stop it, idiot.

1160
01:11:58,038 --> 01:11:58,997
It is chemotherapy.

1161
01:11:59,205 --> 01:12:00,830
-Shut up rascal!
-Shall I tell you something?

1162
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,022
Though Yuvraj Singh had lung cancer,

1163
01:12:03,222 --> 01:12:04,956
he considered it as if
some kind of viral fever

1164
01:12:05,356 --> 01:12:07,580
and won the trophy for India by
playing in the world cup, didn't he?

1165
01:12:07,997 --> 01:12:08,997
This is also the same thing.

1166
01:12:09,163 --> 01:12:10,663
You just don't bother and take it easy.

1167
01:12:10,747 --> 01:12:13,913
Hey, one out of every four guys
is getting cancer these days.

1168
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,408
However, you're the good person
amongst our four-membered gang

1169
01:12:16,481 --> 01:12:17,294
and thus you got it.

1170
01:12:17,309 --> 01:12:18,247
-You're the good guy.
-That's all

1171
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:21,122
Anyhow, would anybody drink in the
pain in the pain that a girl left?

1172
01:12:22,247 --> 01:12:22,756
Look at yourself,

1173
01:12:23,076 --> 01:12:25,812
Your face is like the guy from the tobacco
Ad which gets played before a movie.

1174
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:30,034
Hey, we shall film an Ad for
our fellow love failure friends

1175
01:12:30,209 --> 01:12:32,433
to make them not to
get into this situation.

1176
01:12:32,533 --> 01:12:34,310
-Yes, we shall do
-It's crazy, dude!

1177
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:35,723
-Shall we do it?
-Yes, we will.

1178
01:12:35,823 --> 01:12:36,438
Tell me.

1179
01:12:36,955 --> 01:12:37,615
Come on, tell me.

1180
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:40,830
-Smile dude, come on
-Shall we do that or not?

1181
01:12:41,705 --> 01:12:42,663
-We shall do it.
-Yes!

1182
01:12:42,913 --> 01:12:44,205
What's wrong with these youngsters?

1183
01:12:44,788 --> 01:12:47,163
Love failures on one side
and unemployment on the other side.

1184
01:12:47,372 --> 01:12:48,580
Why doesn't anyone
open up their mouth?

1185
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:51,663
We shall put an end to the negligent
behaviour of these girls.

1186
01:12:51,913 --> 01:12:52,955
My name is Chey.

1187
01:12:53,122 --> 01:12:56,247
I was in a deep love
with a girl for an year.

1188
01:12:56,788 --> 01:13:01,163
Our love started from dubsmash on
phone and went till tattooing on the hand.

1189
01:13:01,538 --> 01:13:03,622
Even then, she went to
the US by leaving me.

1190
01:13:04,038 --> 01:13:06,663
Perhaps, I may not love
any other girl again.

1191
01:13:07,122 --> 01:13:09,580
My aunt had to sell her two bangles.

1192
01:13:14,455 --> 01:13:17,830
Love, love and love!
They are deadly.

1193
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:24,080
Boys, don't fall in love.
Don't let anyone fall.

1194
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:30,995
'Those who search and get back the smiles
that left you, the beliefs you forgot,'

1195
01:13:31,315 --> 01:13:34,819
'and the forgotten courage are friends.'

1196
01:13:36,594 --> 01:13:41,811
[indistinct people chattering]

1197
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,798
I thought to ask money
for Chey's treatment,

1198
01:13:44,334 --> 01:13:46,470
but why did all these people
come to give a lecture to me?

1199
01:13:47,755 --> 01:13:49,872
[sighs]
Arya, cool! Cool!

1200
01:13:52,163 --> 01:13:56,163
Hi Arya. Your brother bagged
a seat in IIT, Hyderabad.

1201
01:13:56,372 --> 01:13:59,788
Your dad is hosting such a big party.
Why did you arrive so late?

1202
01:13:59,955 --> 01:14:01,122
Well, what are you doing now?

1203
01:14:01,455 --> 01:14:02,455
I'm doing, doing...

1204
01:14:02,622 --> 01:14:05,372
You know,
my son is working for Cisco as a Manager.

1205
01:14:05,413 --> 01:14:07,830
I'll ask him and place
you up in a good job.

1206
01:14:07,997 --> 01:14:10,788
Thank you uncle.
But no thanks. I don't need this job.

1207
01:14:11,288 --> 01:14:12,038
Any reason?

1208
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,100
I don't want to do a
job which I don't like

1209
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:16,781
and keep dying every day for
lifelong like your son, uncle.

1210
01:14:16,981 --> 01:14:20,163
What are you saying, Arya?
Respect your elders.

1211
01:14:20,705 --> 01:14:23,080
You always say respect your elders,
respect women and so on.

1212
01:14:23,163 --> 01:14:25,538
Don't we have respect?
Won't we get that? Aren't we humans?

1213
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,288
Arya!

1214
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:31,372
You don't pull us into the competition
you created to satisfy your egos, dad.

1215
01:14:31,788 --> 01:14:34,587
My son is earning so much,
saved so much,

1216
01:14:34,811 --> 01:14:37,083
built a big building,
my son went for a foreign trip...

1217
01:14:37,283 --> 01:14:39,205
Lives are going haywire here
going for such boastings.

1218
01:14:39,455 --> 01:14:40,830
Look at your language, Arya.

1219
01:14:41,038 --> 01:14:43,913
All your peers have
settled in good positions.

1220
01:14:44,247 --> 01:14:45,788
You haven't started your career yet.

1221
01:14:45,997 --> 01:14:47,622
What exactly are you
thinking to do in life?

1222
01:14:47,663 --> 01:14:49,833
Taking birth, growing up, working

1223
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,801
and again giving birth,
growing kids up, and then dying,

1224
01:14:52,247 --> 01:14:53,288
Is this what life's all about?

1225
01:14:53,497 --> 01:14:55,205
I wish to lead a happy life.

1226
01:14:56,038 --> 01:14:59,205
I don't want to get sacrificed to
the pressure created for this society

1227
01:14:59,955 --> 01:15:03,830
Arya, it is my last wish
to see you doing a job.

1228
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:07,538
Huh, get away!
Job, my foot! Killing me...

1229
01:15:14,038 --> 01:15:16,413
-Arya!
-Come here

1230
01:15:16,538 --> 01:15:17,830
What happened, Arya?

1231
01:15:27,997 --> 01:15:32,038
I'm in a bit of frustration,
please cooperate.

1232
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:40,413
Arya, I want things like sex and other
things to be explored only after marriage.

1233
01:15:40,663 --> 01:15:41,663
I can't do it now.

1234
01:15:47,308 --> 01:15:48,652
[glassware breaks]

1235
01:15:53,879 --> 01:15:54,358
Damn!

1236
01:16:06,522 --> 01:16:08,010
[knocking door]

1237
01:16:09,247 --> 01:16:09,997
Geetha!
[knocks]

1238
01:16:11,497 --> 01:16:12,372
Open the door
[knocks]

1239
01:16:12,572 --> 01:16:13,177
Crap!

1240
01:16:17,047 --> 01:16:17,997
[knocks]
Geetha!

1241
01:16:19,497 --> 01:16:22,663
Geetha! Open the door, dear.

1242
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:27,247
What's do you want at this time, dad?

1243
01:16:27,913 --> 01:16:29,622
One of my books is missing, dear.

1244
01:16:30,872 --> 01:16:33,205
I came to see whether it's in your room.

1245
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:35,913
Why would your book be in my room, daddy?

1246
01:16:36,038 --> 01:16:38,247
I came to your room in
the afternoon, dear.

1247
01:16:39,497 --> 01:16:40,872
Why would it be in the bathroom, dad?

1248
01:16:43,788 --> 01:16:44,872
There isn't anything here, dad.

1249
01:16:50,122 --> 01:16:53,330
Who the hell are you?
Come out.

1250
01:16:56,122 --> 01:16:57,663
How dare are you, rascal?

1251
01:16:58,955 --> 01:17:01,047
It is not your mistake.
She is to be blamed.

1252
01:17:04,205 --> 01:17:06,747
She ruined my reputation by falling
in love with someone in 10th standard.

1253
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:11,163
And now, she brought someone into
the room and ruined my reputation again.

1254
01:17:11,705 --> 01:17:12,955
Don't feel very bad, uncle.

1255
01:17:13,538 --> 01:17:14,622
It was me whom she
loved in the tenth standard.

1256
01:17:15,013 --> 01:17:16,330
Won't you leave us?

1257
01:17:17,788 --> 01:17:19,413
However, why should we talk to you?
Come on, rascal.

1258
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:19,997
Dad...

1259
01:17:20,038 --> 01:17:22,507
-If I ever see you around my house,
-Please leave him, dad.

1260
01:17:22,611 --> 01:17:24,346
I'll call the police
and get you thrashed.

1261
01:17:24,628 --> 01:17:25,111
Get lost!

1262
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,538
'All my friends were drowned in grief.'

1263
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,615
On one side, they're trying to save me

1264
01:17:34,203 --> 01:17:37,135
'and on the other side, they are being
tormented in their family problems.'

1265
01:17:51,372 --> 01:17:54,538
Hey Bunty, please switch off the AC.

1266
01:17:55,497 --> 01:17:56,880
The electricity bill is touching the sky.

1267
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,372
Dad, I'm getting burned in this heat.

1268
01:17:59,872 --> 01:18:01,163
Please, try to understand.

1269
01:18:04,432 --> 01:18:07,584
[water rustling]
[birds chirping]

1270
01:18:10,038 --> 01:18:13,497
Chey isn't responding to the chemotherapy
treatment that was done till now.

1271
01:18:13,705 --> 01:18:16,455
What's it Doctor?
He is getting timely treatment, right?

1272
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:19,955
Doctor,
please check the report one more time.

1273
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,372
We checked everything. The size of
the tumour isn't shrinking at all.

1274
01:18:24,455 --> 01:18:27,413
We're able to control even the
tumour cells only with chemotherapy.

1275
01:18:27,497 --> 01:18:28,913
There's an expert doctor in the US.

1276
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:30,747
We shall get him here and
get the operation done.

1277
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:32,122
How much would that cost, doctor?

1278
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:34,497
Approximately 30 Lakhs.

1279
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,372
Why is the main hall so cool?

1280
01:18:48,205 --> 01:18:50,855
Hey donkey, why are you
sleeping like that? Get up!

1281
01:18:50,955 --> 01:18:52,563
My diabetes medicines
would get spoiled for heat.

1282
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:54,580
Get up, get up you waste fellow.

1283
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,455
What's your nuisance in
the morning, grandpa?

1284
01:18:56,497 --> 01:18:58,330
Who the hell would sleep by keeping
his head in the refrigerator? Get up.

1285
01:18:58,372 --> 01:19:00,038
Grandpa... Grandpa!

1286
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:05,038
Keep your butt too in it, waste fellow?

1287
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,163
-The old man is getting paranoid with age.
-Huh!

1288
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:11,163
What happened to all the money
which invested in that project?

1289
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:12,030
That is,

1290
01:19:12,285 --> 01:19:14,953
The new Government has shut down
that scheme citing it to be impractical.

1291
01:19:15,053 --> 01:19:18,330
Oh no! The mill is gone and
even the money invested is gone.

1292
01:19:18,413 --> 01:19:19,617
We didn't get even a single penny

1293
01:19:19,693 --> 01:19:21,736
-and the 5 years time got wasted. [clanks]
-Ah!

1294
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:26,705
It's my ill-fate.
I'm not even left with the Mangalsutra.

1295
01:19:26,747 --> 01:19:27,997
Why are you fighting like that?

1296
01:19:28,288 --> 01:19:30,080
My property is there, right? Use that.

1297
01:19:30,163 --> 01:19:31,455
Yes, it's there!

1298
01:19:31,747 --> 01:19:34,372
What's your property dad?
What do you have?

1299
01:19:34,497 --> 01:19:37,122
Broken cot, old iron trunk...
Are you talking about those things?

1300
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:38,163
They are in good condition, right?

1301
01:19:38,205 --> 01:19:39,872
Koteswara Rao... Koteswara Rao...

1302
01:19:40,788 --> 01:19:42,455
It's been six months since you paid rent.

1303
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:43,872
I'll pay it, sir.

1304
01:19:43,913 --> 01:19:46,497
The new month has started.
Will you pay in this month at least?

1305
01:19:48,063 --> 01:19:50,622
Well, you can't pay it.
Vacate the house.

1306
01:19:51,413 --> 01:19:54,163
If I don't pay by the end of this
month, we'll definitely vacate, sir.

1307
01:19:54,205 --> 01:19:55,788
-This is the last warning.
-Okay, sir.

1308
01:19:55,872 --> 01:19:56,741
You'll be spared if you
pay the rent this month.

1309
01:19:56,933 --> 01:19:58,133
Otherwise, your things will
be thrown out of this house.

1310
01:19:58,333 --> 01:19:59,038
Okay, sir.

1311
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:01,913
I can't live in a house
which is smaller than this.

1312
01:20:02,372 --> 01:20:04,872
Well, we will take you
to a very spacious house.

1313
01:20:05,038 --> 01:20:06,830
Your dad's house is having
just two rooms, isn't it?

1314
01:20:07,247 --> 01:20:08,572
Why my dad's house?

1315
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:11,004
We'll send you to old age
home and you can be there.

1316
01:20:11,304 --> 01:20:11,755
[sighs in anger]
[thud]

1317
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:16,205
-Where are you going, grandpa?
-To the toilet, will you come?

1318
01:20:16,538 --> 01:20:18,205
Damn, you nasty grandpa...

1319
01:20:18,797 --> 01:20:19,901
[slams door]

1320
01:20:20,997 --> 01:20:22,372
What's he doing inside?

1321
01:20:22,572 --> 01:20:23,776
[screams]
[thud]

1322
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:24,630
What's might have happened?

1323
01:20:25,997 --> 01:20:27,288
-Dad
-Grandpa [knocks]

1324
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:29,580
What are you doing inside?
Open the door daddy. [knocking]

1325
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:31,038
Daddy...

1326
01:20:33,202 --> 01:20:33,666
[gasps]

1327
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,913
Won't you even let me die peacefully?

1328
01:20:42,189 --> 01:20:43,060
[weeping]

1329
01:20:44,205 --> 01:20:47,622
Just you stop that crying.
I'll break your jaw.

1330
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,872
I'm seriously asking Arya,
will you marry me or not?

1331
01:20:52,455 --> 01:20:54,997
I'm in a very big tension.
I can't marry you now.

1332
01:20:57,205 --> 01:21:00,997
My dad was correct that you've
been simply passing time with me.

1333
01:21:01,163 --> 01:21:03,872
That's why he got the
best guy as my life partner.

1334
01:21:04,038 --> 01:21:06,288
His name is Rahul and earns a
salary of 1 lakh rupees per month.

1335
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:07,080
Did he find him?

1336
01:21:07,288 --> 01:21:10,413
Good, go and marry Rahul idiot.
Sorry, marry Mr Rahul.

1337
01:21:12,122 --> 01:21:13,288
How much, one lakh?

1338
01:21:13,788 --> 01:21:16,872
Live happily and luxuriously as
an ideal couple with that salary.

1339
01:21:16,913 --> 01:21:17,622
And we'll get rid of the crap!

1340
01:21:17,872 --> 01:21:19,872
What? Rid of the crap?

1341
01:21:20,663 --> 01:21:24,538
Yes, it is the best thing!
I'll marry Rahul. You're a waste fellow.

1342
01:21:24,622 --> 01:21:25,913
Go and marry that guy. Just go.

1343
01:21:27,205 --> 01:21:28,247
Don't call again.

1344
01:21:28,942 --> 01:21:30,540
[phone rings]

1345
01:21:31,247 --> 01:21:32,247
Yes Bunty, tell me.

1346
01:21:32,288 --> 01:21:33,913
Hey, I'm unable to bear the tension dude.

1347
01:21:33,997 --> 01:21:36,705
There's just one solution for all these.
We should have beer.

1348
01:21:36,753 --> 01:21:39,181
[traffic]

1349
01:21:39,381 --> 01:21:42,456
Hey... We thought to get relieved of
the tensions by having chilled beer,

1350
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:43,736
But, what is this mess dude?

1351
01:21:47,213 --> 01:21:48,371
There's just 5 minutes left
for this store to get closed.

1352
01:21:48,379 --> 01:21:49,548
That's the reason for this rush.

1353
01:21:49,648 --> 01:21:50,068
Let's go there.

1354
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:55,705
-Hey move...
-Just move guys...

1355
01:21:55,797 --> 01:21:56,897
-Hey Bunty, take it
-You idiot!

1356
01:21:56,997 --> 01:21:57,709
Hey Bunty...

1357
01:21:57,909 --> 01:21:59,419
Hey... Argh!

1358
01:22:00,788 --> 01:22:03,964
-Bunty, make it fast.
-Give 10 beers, bro.

1359
01:22:04,264 --> 01:22:04,728
Hey...

1360
01:22:04,828 --> 01:22:06,938
Please Brother...
Give 10 beers... 10 beers...

1361
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:08,672
Bunty, get them fast dude.
There isn't any time.

1362
01:22:09,217 --> 01:22:10,566
[roller shutter closing]
Hey...

1363
01:22:11,282 --> 01:22:13,013
-Hey Bunty, look out the shutter.
-Give them quickly, bro.

1364
01:22:13,213 --> 01:22:14,614
Give them quickly, bro.

1365
01:22:15,134 --> 01:22:16,738
-Ah!
-Crap!

1366
01:22:16,938 --> 01:22:18,022
Ah!

1367
01:22:18,494 --> 01:22:20,310
Brother, my friend got stuck.
Lift the shutter, bro.

1368
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:21,340
Hey Bunty, careful.

1369
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:27,548
[screams]

1370
01:22:27,782 --> 01:22:28,487
Bunty...

1371
01:22:29,962 --> 01:22:30,788
Hey Bunty!

1372
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:31,778
Mommy!

1373
01:22:31,978 --> 01:22:32,872
Hey Bunty!

1374
01:22:32,913 --> 01:22:35,552
Please... Down the shutter bro.
Please...

1375
01:22:35,752 --> 01:22:37,330
Brother, my friend is stuck.
Bring down the shutter.

1376
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:38,444
Bunty...

1377
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:42,122
Hey... Dhruv!

1378
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:49,465
[ears ringing]

1379
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:54,080
Hey Bunty!

1380
01:22:54,622 --> 01:22:55,497
Hey Bunty!

1381
01:22:58,455 --> 01:23:00,205
Hey, I tried very hard dude.

1382
01:23:00,372 --> 01:23:01,830
Damn,
I didn't get even one beer.

1383
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:03,916
Hey, you don't take any tension.

1384
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:06,076
We'll definitely but the
beer and drink it at home.

1385
01:23:09,205 --> 01:23:10,288
Hey, he is here.

1386
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:12,580
Bro, we need three beers.

1387
01:23:13,372 --> 01:23:14,205
I have two beers.

1388
01:23:15,038 --> 01:23:16,455
-How much?
-500 rupees

1389
01:23:16,705 --> 01:23:17,330
500?

1390
01:23:17,705 --> 01:23:19,372
500? Why 500?

1391
01:23:19,413 --> 01:23:21,413
Why 500?
Well, make it 600 then.

1392
01:23:22,705 --> 01:23:23,872
Bro, give two for 500.

1393
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:31,898
[siren]

1394
01:23:32,116 --> 01:23:33,074
The police are arriving...

1395
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:35,538
-Hey, police dude!
-Come on, quickly get on the vehicle.

1396
01:23:35,872 --> 01:23:36,997
Hey, move...
[siren]

1397
01:23:38,288 --> 01:23:40,080
Hey, start it quickly.
They're coming.

1398
01:23:40,372 --> 01:23:41,105
Hey, start it dude.

1399
01:23:41,205 --> 01:23:42,160
Hey, the battery is down.

1400
01:23:42,352 --> 01:23:44,561
-Push it, dude. Make it quick.
-Zip it!

1401
01:23:44,761 --> 01:23:45,813
Move it, fast.
[siren]

1402
01:23:45,913 --> 01:23:47,688
Hey, they are here dude.
Kickstart it.

1403
01:23:47,788 --> 01:23:49,647
Hey, stop the vehicle.
Where did you get beers at this time?

1404
01:23:49,747 --> 01:23:50,730
They are mine, sir...

1405
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:52,230
-Give that beer to me
-No, I won't give

1406
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:53,605
-Give here, idiot
-I won't give

1407
01:23:53,705 --> 01:23:55,393
-You won't listen to words.
-Push fast.

1408
01:23:55,593 --> 01:23:56,638
-You should take the hit.
-Mommy!

1409
01:23:56,838 --> 01:23:58,063
-Hey, push... Push...
-Start the engine...

1410
01:23:58,064 --> 01:23:59,158
-Quickly push...
-Ouch!

1411
01:23:59,318 --> 01:24:00,742
-It's not getting started.
-Ouch!

1412
01:24:00,942 --> 01:24:02,146
Hey, he's hitting me...

1413
01:24:02,222 --> 01:24:04,363
[bike engine starts]
Get on the bike, the vehicle started.

1414
01:24:05,203 --> 01:24:06,455
Keep going...

1415
01:24:08,629 --> 01:24:09,029
Damn you!

1416
01:24:09,906 --> 01:24:10,803
Ouch!
[bottle shatters]

1417
01:24:13,122 --> 01:24:14,504
Why is God very hard on us?

1418
01:24:14,808 --> 01:24:17,544
Won't he bless us?
Why does he have so much anger on us?

1419
01:24:17,772 --> 01:24:19,288
I think we are born at the worst time.

1420
01:24:19,372 --> 01:24:19,955
You are right dude!

1421
01:24:20,497 --> 01:24:23,708
When we wish to have a chilled beer
to forget all tensions for some time,

1422
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:25,083
Even that's not working out.

1423
01:24:25,183 --> 01:24:26,913
Huh! The quality of
beer over here is waste.

1424
01:24:27,872 --> 01:24:30,955
One of my friends went to Europe
and brought the beer they manufactured.

1425
01:24:31,163 --> 01:24:32,473
Drinking one such beer is enough,

1426
01:24:32,782 --> 01:24:35,242
You'll have instant harmony and
it feels like you're in heaven.

1427
01:24:35,705 --> 01:24:36,830
Would it be so tasty?

1428
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:38,413
Just one beer is enough

1429
01:24:38,788 --> 01:24:40,288
But still,
how would they manufacture that?

1430
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,872
Hey idiot, what exactly is a beer?

1431
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,497
-What?
-Wheat

1432
01:24:46,138 --> 01:24:46,955
Wheat?

1433
01:24:46,997 --> 01:24:47,785
Yes, it is made up of wheat.

1434
01:24:48,089 --> 01:24:51,450
They put some bacteria that is used
in making bread and add beer flavour.

1435
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:51,963
That's it

1436
01:24:52,163 --> 01:24:54,163
-Is it that easy?
-Then, what did you think man?

1437
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:56,478
In Europe, people won't be standing
in a line to buy beer unlike here

1438
01:24:56,830 --> 01:25:01,085
where we feel getting one beer as equal
to winning Kabaddi World Cup for India.

1439
01:25:01,285 --> 01:25:03,747
In Europe, they prepare their
own beer and get chilled.

1440
01:25:04,163 --> 01:25:06,963
Hey, shut up! How do they make
beer so easily? I won't believe it.

1441
01:25:07,063 --> 01:25:08,838
-Hey...
-He won't believe anything without proofs.

1442
01:25:09,112 --> 01:25:09,570
Show him.

1443
01:25:11,913 --> 01:25:12,497
See dude...

1444
01:25:15,955 --> 01:25:17,038
He's a kid, dude.

1445
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:18,006
[indistinct audio from the mobile]

1446
01:25:18,426 --> 01:25:19,663
Did the police hit you very hard, dude?

1447
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:21,997
They blasted my back, dude.
It is swollen.

1448
01:25:22,038 --> 01:25:23,372
Didn't he get beaten?

1449
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:30,955
Bro, what if we make our own beer?

1450
01:25:31,155 --> 01:25:37,127
[music]

1451
01:25:47,365 --> 01:25:48,046
[door opens]

1452
01:25:48,771 --> 01:25:50,461
[birds flapping]

1453
01:26:00,342 --> 01:26:01,366
[birds flapping]

1454
01:26:06,653 --> 01:26:07,097
[bird flapping]

1455
01:26:21,072 --> 01:26:23,266
[grinding stone screeching]

1456
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:46,080
Hey... Basically, there will
be six steps in brewing beer.

1457
01:26:46,122 --> 01:26:47,497
The first step is milling.

1458
01:26:47,697 --> 01:26:48,123
[burbles]

1459
01:26:48,323 --> 01:26:50,524
In this step, we shall soak
the wheat for the entire night.

1460
01:26:51,497 --> 01:26:56,580
They get sprouts by the morning.
That is called the Malt.

1461
01:26:56,997 --> 01:26:59,372
They should be dried in
the morning and ground.

1462
01:27:02,105 --> 01:27:04,126
The step 2 is mashing.

1463
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:05,341
In mashing,

1464
01:27:05,497 --> 01:27:10,269
we should put the ground pulp in the
first container and boil it in hot water.

1465
01:27:18,205 --> 01:27:20,377
The step 3 is called lottering.

1466
01:27:20,577 --> 01:27:21,415
The boiled liquid should be...

1467
01:27:21,523 --> 01:27:23,927
...taken into the second container
by separating it from the pulp.

1468
01:27:24,079 --> 01:27:25,063
The hops are to be mixed in that.

1469
01:27:25,263 --> 01:27:26,538
Hops? What's hops?

1470
01:27:26,638 --> 01:27:30,327
It is a flavour which decides whether
it's a strong beer or a light beer.

1471
01:27:33,788 --> 01:27:38,997
Hey Arya, what are these lights, heat,
these plants? What's all this setup?

1472
01:27:39,305 --> 01:27:43,038
Basically, all the beer manufacturers
add artificial flavours in it.

1473
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,306
But unlike them,

1474
01:27:44,413 --> 01:27:46,705
I made this set up to use plants
and use the natural flavours.

1475
01:27:46,905 --> 01:27:50,363
Because these plants grow only in
40 degree North Equatorial region

1476
01:27:50,667 --> 01:27:53,339
in a particular climatic
conditions and temperatures.

1477
01:27:53,539 --> 01:27:54,966
Alright, but how do they grow in our room?

1478
01:27:55,205 --> 01:27:57,947
That's why I've arranged this setup
of lighting and a certain temperature.

1479
01:27:58,288 --> 01:28:00,747
We are recreating those conditions
with this setup over here.

1480
01:28:03,163 --> 01:28:04,179
The step 4 is

1481
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:07,301
We have to take the liquid mixed
with hops into the third container

1482
01:28:07,393 --> 01:28:08,777
and cool that with a chiller.

1483
01:28:08,977 --> 01:28:09,439
Oh!

1484
01:28:09,539 --> 01:28:11,655
The step 5 is to add yeast in that.

1485
01:28:11,855 --> 01:28:13,580
Yeast is the good bacteria.

1486
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,313
The one which you said on that day
regarding the bacteria for making bread.

1487
01:28:15,397 --> 01:28:16,122
Yes, that one.

1488
01:28:16,247 --> 01:28:17,611
This helps for the fermentation.

1489
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:21,397
We add curd in milk to make curd, right?
That's called fermentation.

1490
01:28:21,497 --> 01:28:25,247
Similarly,
this yeast converts that liquid into beer.

1491
01:28:25,288 --> 01:28:29,330
The end product which we get after
refrigerating is nothing but our beer.

1492
01:28:47,058 --> 01:28:47,590
[explodes]

1493
01:28:48,497 --> 01:28:49,830
-Oh no!
-Damn!

1494
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,416
Hey, pour the water.

1495
01:28:58,582 --> 01:29:00,327
[fire dowsed]

1496
01:29:01,206 --> 01:29:01,710
[coughs]

1497
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:04,288
Hey, why did it happen like this?

1498
01:29:04,355 --> 01:29:06,997
It's normal dude.
Let's do it again from the beginning.

1499
01:29:07,122 --> 01:29:08,622
It'll be done.

1500
01:29:10,872 --> 01:29:15,538
Hey, listen to me. Today isn't a good day.
Let's start tomorrow with a fresh mind.

1501
01:29:15,938 --> 01:29:17,730
Nothing bad would happen, it'll
be done. We started it, right?

1502
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:19,730
I don't understand
anything, I'll be outside.

1503
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:21,480
-We'll do it tomorrow morning.
-Dhruv, listen to me

1504
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:23,061
Let's go to the hospital to meet Chey.

1505
01:29:23,121 --> 01:29:24,201
-Dhruv.
-Come dude.

1506
01:29:26,576 --> 01:29:28,964
Hey... Make sure that there aren't
any blasts or nothing of that sort.

1507
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:30,004
Hey, nothing will happen to us.

1508
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:33,368
-Hey Bunty
-Yes

1509
01:29:33,409 --> 01:29:35,326
Where did you park my black Mercedes?

1510
01:29:37,034 --> 01:29:37,951
Look there, dude

1511
01:29:38,868 --> 01:29:41,534
Yes, behind my red BMW

1512
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:43,451
Hey, get that quickly.
I have to go to America.

1513
01:29:44,034 --> 01:29:45,034
Okay, we'll go.

1514
01:29:45,409 --> 01:29:48,858
"If the pin pierces you,"

1515
01:29:49,066 --> 01:29:52,122
"it's my mistake"

1516
01:29:52,522 --> 01:29:55,728
"My heart fell for it"

1517
01:29:57,576 --> 01:29:59,826
Nurse, why are my eyes are
getting red when I drink?

1518
01:29:59,868 --> 01:30:00,868
Give up drinking.

1519
01:30:01,284 --> 01:30:02,136
[chuckles]

1520
01:30:02,576 --> 01:30:04,659
-Is it painful dude?
-No.

1521
01:30:04,826 --> 01:30:06,218
I got adapted to repeated piercing.

1522
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:07,978
Hey...
Nothing happens to me, right?

1523
01:30:08,178 --> 01:30:08,826
Hey, nothing will happen dude.

1524
01:30:08,868 --> 01:30:10,826
Hey, what'll happen to you dude?
We're here right?

1525
01:30:12,576 --> 01:30:14,201
-Hey, slowly
-Nothing will happen.

1526
01:30:15,409 --> 01:30:17,826
I have an important
client meeting at the office.

1527
01:30:17,926 --> 01:30:21,451
The delegates arrived from the US,
so I am unable to come to Hyderabad.

1528
01:30:21,493 --> 01:30:22,993
Damn! What's this client meeting dude?

1529
01:30:23,218 --> 01:30:24,493
She's been torturing me

I think God loves humans very much.

1563

That's why he sent ambrosia in the
form of beer for everyone to be happy.

1564
01:33:49,409 --> 01:33:53,034
Hey dude, this is the right time
to take our beer to the next level.

1565
01:33:53,076 --> 01:33:55,618
Yes dude,
we should start selling our beer.

1566
01:33:56,284 --> 01:33:59,409
Let's sell it online.
We can have door delivery system

1567
01:34:00,326 --> 01:34:02,643
-It is a crazy idea.
-It is simply superb!

There's hell lot of process for that.

1570
01:34:05,659 --> 01:34:06,907
We shall first create the logo,

1571
01:34:07,083 --> 01:34:09,995
then create e-commerce
website and make beer-bottling...

1572
01:34:10,095 --> 01:34:12,201
Hey, we can make that beer-bottling.

1573

There's my uncle's godown
in Boduppal, right?

1574
01:34:14,951 --> 01:34:17,326
If we procure in a bulk way, we can
get an empty bottle for 2 rupees.

1575
01:34:17,909 --> 01:34:18,909
It's crazy, dude.

1576
01:34:19,034 --> 01:34:21,451
Let's get the website done online.
It'll be done in 5000 rupees.

1577
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:23,368
By the way,
what shall we name this?

1578
01:34:26,368 --> 01:34:27,784
Kaboom... is what we shall name it.

1579
01:34:28,284 --> 01:34:29,076

Kaboom means explosion, bang!

1581
01:34:31,368 --> 01:34:35,451
Those drinking our beer should forget
frustrations, tensions and everything.

1582
01:34:35,493 --> 01:34:36,368
They should get their minds blasted.

1583

-Let's make a crazy Ad.
-Why?

1590
01:35:10,593 --> 01:35:12,993
Because the public should
know about our beer, right?

1591
01:35:13,201 --> 01:35:15,784
Right, isn't it? Then, we
shall film with the white guys.

1592
01:35:16,534 --> 01:35:17,534
Why do we need white guys?

1593
01:35:17,634 --> 01:35:19,368
Our guys believe to
whatever the white guys say.

1607
01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:13,909
That's why I said not to
do an Ad with that black guy.

01:36:14,034 --> 01:36:16,243
Hey idiot, he is the one
we found within our budget.

We need money for our son's operation.

We aren't getting money
despite asking everywhere.

1712

You should somehow help me

1713

Hey, are you the police or rented goons?

1716
01:40:56,659 --> 01:40:59,951
To hell with your lives, rascals.
Open it, I didn't drink.

1717
01:41:00,076 --> 01:41:03,576
Your meter is wrong.
Uff... Here, check

I didn't drink, guys.

Oh no, I didn't drink.
Somebody get me a bail, man.

Hey Khaki shirt! Are you SI or CI,

What brothers, what happened?
Why are you brought here?

1722
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:25,284
-We made beer
-You made beer?

1723
01:41:26,909 --> 01:41:31,368
All make it and drink.
Is that wrong too? What justice is this?

1724
01:41:32,243 --> 01:41:35,951
Hello!
You deaf idiots, I'm talking to you.

1725

Leave that, you look stylish
with a dog tag on your neck.

1726

Even my wife left me and went away

1797
01:46:00,701 --> 01:46:02,868
I wish that even a Pakistani
shouldn't face these problems, bro.

1798
01:46:03,243 --> 01:46:07,201
You do what you like and don't get into
jobs thinking life should be secured.

1799
01:46:07,301 --> 01:46:09,226
Bro, they brought us here
for doing what we like.

1800
01:46:09,326 --> 01:46:13,034
Hey, you don't worry guys.
Laddu bro is there and he'll take care.

-Good morning, SI sir.
-Good morning.

1803

Yes, Laddu bro's men have come.

1804
01:46:17,909 --> 01:46:20,159
These are Raj's bail papers.

1805
01:46:20,993 --> 01:46:22,534
Bro, they are our guys.
Bail them out too.

'In that way, Raj Bollam entered
into our lives like a cyclone.'

Your wedding with Rahul
is just two months away.

1812
01:46:39,284 --> 01:46:40,791
-I don't want to marry Rahul...
-I don't want to listen to anything.

1813
01:46:41,111 --> 01:46:42,999
Get into your room. Go!

1814
01:46:45,409 --> 01:46:46,659
You've brought a bad name for our family.

1815
01:46:47,034 --> 01:46:48,577
Looks like your brother Shourya
will get spoilt because of you.

1816
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:50,177
It's better that you leave the house.

1817
01:47:00,326 --> 01:47:02,618
-Hello
-Arya, did you go to jail?

1818
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:03,576
Yes. So, what?

1819
01:47:03,701 --> 01:47:05,328
Idiot, why are you doing so?

1820
01:47:05,452 --> 01:47:07,840
My dad is threatening to
get me married to Rahul.

1821
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:08,893
Good, marry him.

1822
01:47:10,214 --> 01:47:10,638
Damn!

1823
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:17,644
[phone ringing]

1824
01:47:22,076 --> 01:47:23,451
You became very popular.

1825
01:47:23,535 --> 01:47:27,368
As I pampered being motherless,
your works have been so.

1826
01:47:38,576 --> 01:47:39,618
Where are you going son?

1827
01:47:39,785 --> 01:47:42,993
I'm getting bored being here daily, mom.
I'll go, meet friends for some time.

1828
01:47:43,035 --> 01:47:45,285
Not even one guy came and
visited you for so many days.

1829
01:47:46,201 --> 01:47:48,076
They'll have their own
tensions mom, leave it.

1830
01:47:48,493 --> 01:47:51,018
Are you understanding how
much tension I'm taking?

1831
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:52,618
Take care of your health first, son.

1832
01:47:53,035 --> 01:47:56,326
Mommy, you don't take
any tension and be happy.

1833
01:47:56,410 --> 01:47:59,160
Nothing will happen to me. See,
I'll just go and be back immediately.

1834
01:47:59,493 --> 01:48:01,243
Okay? You don't take any tension.

1835
01:48:03,618 --> 01:48:06,410
Hey, why are you guys
taking me into the bushes?

1836
01:48:06,993 --> 01:48:08,785
Are you taking a good
care of my guy or not?

1837
01:48:08,826 --> 01:48:10,660
Is he any kid to take care?

1838
01:48:10,785 --> 01:48:12,410
He's moving around in the
house as if his own house.

1839
01:48:12,618 --> 01:48:14,160
He's been moving carefree in the house.

1840
01:48:14,451 --> 01:48:15,785
Why are you wearing a
jacket in the sun, dude?

1841
01:48:16,410 --> 01:48:17,868
No idea, but I'm feeling very cold.

1842
01:48:18,368 --> 01:48:18,893
And this Beanie?

1843
01:48:18,976 --> 01:48:20,826
I'm losing hair heavily
because of the treatment.

1844
01:48:20,868 --> 01:48:22,660
No problem dude,
everything would be alright.

1845
01:48:22,826 --> 01:48:24,451
How is our Mahishmati, bro?

1846
01:48:24,493 --> 01:48:25,785
It's like hell, move.

1847
01:48:26,035 --> 01:48:26,660
Surprise!

1848
01:48:30,076 --> 01:48:30,660
Go, bro.

1849
01:48:31,368 --> 01:48:32,535
What, should I go into that?

1850
01:48:33,326 --> 01:48:35,243
Am I a rat to scroll into that?

1851
01:48:35,410 --> 01:48:37,285
Either rats or we shall
go in this way, move.

1852
01:48:38,243 --> 01:48:40,993
-Oh no...
-Slowly

1853
01:48:41,410 --> 01:48:44,160
-Oh no...
-Slowly

1854
01:48:48,326 --> 01:48:49,326
Are you shocked?

1855
01:48:49,743 --> 01:48:52,201
-Hey, why is everything bizarre here?
-Of course, it would be.

1856
01:48:54,076 --> 01:48:55,660
This is our beer factory, bro.

1857
01:49:04,785 --> 01:49:05,410
Kaboom!

1858
01:49:05,743 --> 01:49:06,368
Kaboom?

1859
01:49:08,326 --> 01:49:09,368
What's Kaboom?

1860
01:49:10,618 --> 01:49:12,201
Boom!
Any guy drinking should get banged.

1861
01:49:12,368 --> 01:49:14,451
Basically, an explosion.
So it would be that crazy.

1862
01:49:14,535 --> 01:49:15,951
Drink, come on drink bro.

1863
01:49:16,326 --> 01:49:16,993
Open it dude.
[fizzes]

1864
01:49:17,118 --> 01:49:18,785
Look, you too will go

-Get one more, don't waste time
-Hey, bring all the beers.

"Hey... Hoi!"

1893
01:51:29,301 --> 01:51:32,201
Hey, I wish to be the
same with you forever.

1894
01:51:33,368 --> 01:51:36,035
Hey, nothing will happen to you.

1895
01:51:36,076 --> 01:51:38,326
You'll be with us and you'll be good.
Listen to us.

1896
01:51:38,951 --> 01:51:41,451
Bro, tortures have gone high in our lives.

1897
01:51:41,535 --> 01:51:43,851
Yes bro, life has become very restless.

1898
01:51:43,951 --> 01:51:45,685
Hey, we shall do something.

1899
01:51:45,785 --> 01:51:47,435
Whatever it is,

We don't have such courage, bro.

1903
01:51:54,576 --> 01:51:57,951
-Hey, what exactly is life?
-What do you mean?

1904
01:51:58,285 --> 01:52:01,618
Define life in a single word.

-Friends dude
-Wow! Well said, bro!

1909
01:52:10,026 --> 01:52:12,785
Hey, let's together
start a hangout place.

1910
01:52:13,010 --> 01:52:14,543
Friends like us should come there,

1911
01:52:15,015 --> 01:52:19,967
have great food, listen to good
music, have beer and enjoy greatly.

1912
01:52:20,167 --> 01:52:21,285
Crazy idea, dude!

1913
01:52:21,326 --> 01:52:22,993
Hey, this sounds great.

1914
01:52:23,135 --> 01:52:25,743
Hey, Chey will play live music.

1915
01:52:25,826 --> 01:52:27,035
And we got our own beer.

1916
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:28,576
Hey, what shall I do then?

1917
01:52:29,718 --> 01:52:33,701
You are the chef, right?
You just made us great food.

1918
01:52:33,743 --> 01:52:35,785
-You cooked the food very deliciously.
-Yes

1919
01:52:36,343 --> 01:52:37,776
-Is it? Is it very delicious?
-Yes.

1920
01:52:37,834 --> 01:52:39,747
What did you wish to do
leaving that corporate life?

1921
01:52:39,839 --> 01:52:41,648
-To become a chef?
-To become that, right bro?

1922
01:52:41,848 --> 01:52:42,851
But, would I really be able to do that?

1923
01:52:42,951 --> 01:52:44,118
-Bro, who did all this?
-You did it in a very wonderful way, bro

1924
01:52:44,218 --> 01:52:46,868
Who did? Tell me, who did all this?

1925
01:52:47,201 --> 01:52:49,368
-Seriously, guys?
-Yes and you fix for it.

1926
01:52:50,401 --> 01:52:51,893
-Let's do it
-Say cheers. Say cheers!

1927
01:52:51,993 --> 01:52:54,606
-We shall make it phenomenal.
-Move, we shall do it for sure.

1928
01:52:57,076 --> 01:53:00,035
Hey, we shall now go legally
for Rest-O-Bar setup.

1929
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:03,118
Yes, no one should point
fingers at us this time.

1930
01:53:04,118 --> 01:53:05,618
What all do we need for that?

1931
01:53:06,285 --> 01:53:09,035
-Liquor license.
-Food license.

1932
01:53:09,651 --> 01:53:10,826
Then, the location?

1933
01:53:10,944 --> 01:53:13,410
Not all those, money is the first and
the foremost thing that we need.

1934
01:53:13,701 --> 01:53:15,285
Hey patient, move aside.

1935
01:53:17,705 --> 01:53:21,170
Here is my salary slip and when
we keep these flat papers too,

1936
01:53:21,214 --> 01:53:22,722
we will easily get a loan from the bank.

1937
01:53:25,701 --> 01:53:26,993
You don't need to do this.

1938
01:53:28,243 --> 01:53:29,785
I'm doing it as I liked it.

1939
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:31,584
If I do this job for one few more days,

1940
01:53:31,807 --> 01:53:34,591
you will immediately admit me
in Erragadda Mental Hospital.

1941
01:53:35,797 --> 01:53:37,299
Still, nothing is lost now.

1942
01:53:37,877 --> 01:53:40,851
I wish to enjoy my life
happily in my terms.

1943
01:53:40,951 --> 01:53:41,910
Super!

1944
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:45,368
Then, I and Dhruv will go to the bank
with Raj's papers and apply for a loan.

1945
01:53:45,576 --> 01:53:47,368
I and Arya will search for locations.

1946
01:53:48,035 --> 01:53:51,210

-It is good, dude.
-This place is crazy.

1949
01:53:57,993 --> 01:53:59,001
I liked it very much.

1950
01:53:59,101 --> 01:54:01,243
The location is easy to find
and it is on the main road.

1951
01:54:10,076 --> 01:54:12,285
We shall setup a
kitchen over there for Raj.

1952
01:54:15,076 --> 01:54:17,326
Bunty and Dhruv will
setup brewery here.

1953
01:54:17,368 --> 01:54:21,618
My dad fixed engagement for me
and Rahul on the 18th next month.

1954
01:54:21,951 --> 01:54:24,285
[mesage notification tone]
He is now taking me out.

1955
01:54:24,368 --> 01:54:28,160
I will make a setup of live music on
that platform which is on the left side.

1956
01:54:29,368 --> 01:54:31,068
-What happened, dude?
-Nothing.

1957
01:54:31,268 --> 01:54:31,976
Any problem?

1958
01:54:32,076 --> 01:54:34,043
-Where shall we put up live music?
-Over there.

1960
01:54:42,951 --> 01:54:45,785

We'll show these papers to the
advocate, take legal opinion

1966
01:54:57,236 --> 01:54:59,972
and finally, we will sanction
the loan with manager's approval.

1967
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:03,410
How long would it take for all
this process to complete, sir?

1968
01:55:03,818 --> 01:55:05,493
All the papers are genuine.

1969

It takes maximum one week, it'll be done.

1970

1979
01:55:29,076 --> 01:55:30,493
We can get Chey operated.

It's difficult, bro.

Hey Arya, Geetha is moving
around here with some other guy.

1995

She got engaged with another guy.

Not food indigestion sir.
Job... I'm not liking the job, sir.

2036
01:58:20,468 --> 01:58:22,243
What, isn't the parrot flying?

2037
01:58:22,343 --> 01:58:24,660
What shall I do if your parrot
isn't flying, bloody idiot?

2038
01:58:25,368 --> 01:58:28,976
Not the parrot, you fool. Job...
I'm resigning to the job.

2039
01:58:29,076 --> 01:58:32,893
Are you designing a new project?
Oh my baby, cool! Do it.

01:58:40,076 --> 01:58:43,535
Yes, sweet potato. Place that in your ear.

2043
01:58:43,635 --> 01:58:46,476
Did you say that you want
to take good care of me? Why?

2044
01:58:46,576 --> 01:58:49,185
Hey, what's taking good care of you?

2045
01:58:49,341 --> 01:58:51,345
You anaconda faced rascal
born on no moon day!

2046
01:58:51,618 --> 01:58:54,168
What, you came to Manikonda?

2047
01:58:54,268 --> 01:58:55,707
I'm coming to do your final rites.

2048
01:58:55,948 --> 01:58:59,067
You want to bow to me?
Alright, come. Come and do it.

He said that the code is ready.

2055
01:59:23,993 --> 01:59:25,451
Where is he?

2056
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:42,160
Hey Raj, didn't you say
that the code is ready.

2057
01:59:42,243 --> 01:59:44,641
To think creatively by
throwing us into a 4 x 4 box,

2058
01:59:44,717 --> 01:59:45,918
How do you think that it
would happen, you rascal?

2059
01:59:46,118 --> 01:59:47,428
Rascal?
You're fired.

2060
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:51,060

You shall serve two months
notice period, okay?

2065
02:00:06,510 --> 02:00:07,950
Do I have to serve two
months notice period?

2066
02:00:09,418 --> 02:00:11,588
Okay. Here is the first month

2067
02:00:12,372 --> 02:00:12,824
Oh man!

2068

Die, you waste idiot!

2069
02:00:18,743 --> 02:00:20,428
He said he would take good
care of me, didn't he?

Hey, what're you doing?

2083
02:01:01,576 --> 02:01:03,743
I kept Raj's photo in a matrimony site.

2084
02:01:03,826 --> 02:01:05,201
Wow!

2085
02:01:06,618 --> 02:01:08,201

Hey, you guys have ruined my
life from the day you came.

2088
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:15,160
What's this dude?
Where did you get me?

2089
02:01:18,826 --> 02:01:21,410
-What's this, dude?
-You come bro, nothing will happen

2090
02:01:24,785 --> 02:01:26,035
Who are those two people?

2091
02:01:26,301 --> 02:01:28,368
They look great, right bro?
They are his assistants.

2092
02:01:28,410 --> 02:01:29,326
What's this?

2093

We'll keep it simple.

02:03:51,693 --> 02:03:53,621
Hey, forget that girl.

2123
02:03:57,475 --> 02:04:01,137
It's tough to forget the girl
but everything is slowly settling.

2124

What is settling, rascal?

2125

-Hey!

2133
02:04:22,675 --> 02:04:25,448
Not just in my bank but will see to
that you won't get a loan in any bank.

2134
02:04:30,086 --> 02:04:34,957
The point is, he is the manager for the
bank for which we have applied for a loan.

2135
02:04:37,289 --> 02:04:38,540
That fellow challenged us.

2136
02:04:39,019 --> 02:04:39,987
Not just this bank,

2137
02:04:40,187 --> 02:04:42,961
but he'll see that no other bank
in this city would give us a loan.

2138

-Nothing happened bro.

2141
02:04:52,617 --> 02:04:54,021
-Hey, get lost!
-I didn't do it intentionally.

2142
02:04:54,267 --> 02:04:55,738
-You'll die in my hands.
-Bro, wait.

2143

-Daily!
-Yes, bro.

Bro,
we shall go and ask Laddu bro for finance.

Ahh! It isn't such a simple matter.

02:06:14,886 --> 02:06:15,348
Why?

2175
02:06:15,548 --> 02:06:16,922
If we don't pay the monthly payment,

he will break the bones and use
the marrow as stuff for his drinks.

2177
02:06:22,134 --> 02:06:26,936

scolded will go real now.

Do you know what is
the biggest risk in life?

2181
02:06:34,173 --> 02:06:35,331
It's not to take up any risk.

Success rate in this operation is just 5%.

2242

So, it's good that you keep Chaitanya as
happier as possible before this operation.
